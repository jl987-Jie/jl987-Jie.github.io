### Brief History

Mark I Perceptron

Widrow and Hoff 1960: Adaline and Madaline

Rumelhart 1986 - first time backpropagation becomes popular

Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006 - reinvigorated research in deep learning
restricted Boltzmann machine

Acoustic Modeling using Deep Belief Networks 2010 Mohamed, Dahl, Hinton

Context-Dependent Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition 2012 Dahl, Yu, Deng and Acero

Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks 2012 Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton 2012.

### What gave rise to CNN?

Hubel and Wiesel: how neurons in the visual cortex works? They put electrodes in the cat's brain and gave cat different brain stimulus. They measure the response of the neurons to these stimuli.

What they found out is that there are these topographical mapping in the cortex. Nearby cells in the cortex represent nearby regions in the visual field.

1980 Neurocognitron [Fukushima]
