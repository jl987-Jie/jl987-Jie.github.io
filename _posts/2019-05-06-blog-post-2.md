### Notes from book "High Dimensional Probability" - Using Probability to Cover a Geometric Set

### Caratheodory's theorem

*Every point in the convex hull of a set $T \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed as a convex combination of at most $n + 1$ points from $T$.*

However if we approximate the point $x \in \text{conv}(T)$, the number of required points does not need to depend on the dimension $n$.
